    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      You can't go wrong with this traditional Greek salad, especially if you
      remember the only and most important tip: toss it with the vinegar first
      before adding olive oil. If you don't, it will not taste as good. Which
      reminds me, giving the amounts here is very difficult, since this really
      should be made to your tastes, so please use the ingredient list as a very
      rough outline.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large English cucumbers</li>
      <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>¼ red onion</li>
      <li>½ red bell pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup pitted Kalamata olives</li>
      <li>½ cup pitted green olives</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar, or to taste</li>
      <li>⅓ cup olive oil, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese, diced, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel off a few strips of cucumber skin using a channel knife, creating a
        striped pattern. Cut cucumbers in half crosswise. Cut each half into
        quarters before cutting into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices. Place into a
        colander; toss with some kosher salt and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, cut cherry tomatoes in half. Rinse cucumbers; drain
        thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        While cucumbers are draining, slice onion thinly. Cut bell pepper into
        strips. Turn knife diagonally and cut strips into diamond-shaped pieces.
        Slice Kalamata and green olives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, olives, and 2
        tablespoons oregano in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and
        cayenne. Sprinkle in vinegar and toss thoroughly. Drizzle in olive oil.
        Add about 2/3 of the feta cheese and toss again. Cover with plastic wrap
        and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give the salad another mix. Taste and season as desired. Scatter
        remaining feta cheese on top and garnish with remaining oregano.
      </li>
    </ol>
